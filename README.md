## Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ilia, I am a Python developer

### About me

I started my journey in IT in 2021 by learning the basics of HTML and CSS, and in 2022 I completely focused on the backend. I am now confident in Python, Django and DRF. My plans include further improvement in algorithms and data structures, as well as gaining commercial experience. <br>
I will be glad to communicate with you and new opportunities that the Universe opens for us )
